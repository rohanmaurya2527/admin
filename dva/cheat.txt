Detailed Viva Cheat Sheet – Data Analysis & Visualization 
(M.Sc. Data Science & AI – RJS/PGDSAI102 & 102P) 
Unit I – Introduction to Data Analysis 
Q1. What is Data Analysis? 
• Definition: Process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful 
insights, support decision-making, and solve problems. 
• Why important? Helps identify patterns, trends, and correlations. 
• Example: Analyzing sales data to find which product sells most in festive season. 
Q2. What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)? 
• Definition: Initial investigation of data using summary statistics and visual methods. 
• Why? To detect missing values, outliers, distributions. 
• Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 
• Example: Plotting histogram of ages in a dataset to check skewness. 
Q3. Data Analytics vs Data Analysis? 
• Data Analysis = Inspecting datasets to extract insights. 
• Data Analytics = Broader, includes predictive modeling, machine learning, dashboards. 
• Example: Analysis = calculating average sales. Analytics = predicting next year’s sales 
using ML. 
Q4. What is ETL? 
• Extract (pull data from sources like databases, CSV, APIs) 
• Transform (clean, standardize, aggregate data) 
• Load (store into data warehouse/lake for reporting). 
• Example: Banking data pulled from branches, cleaned for duplicates, and stored in 
central data warehouse. 
Q5. What are Data Repositories? 
• Data Lake: Stores raw, unstructured data. 
• Data Warehouse: Stores structured, processed data for reporting. 
• Data Mart: Subset of data warehouse focused on specific domain (e.g., sales, HR). 
Unit II – Data Sources 
Q6. Different Data File Formats? 
• CSV/Excel: Tabular data. 
• JSON/XML: Hierarchical data (web APIs). 
• SQL Databases: Structured relational data. 
• Binary formats: Faster access, e.g., Parquet, Avro. 
Q7. What is Data Wrangling? 
• Process of cleaning, reshaping, and merging raw data into usable format. 
• Includes: handling missing values, renaming columns, normalizing formats. 
• Example: Converting “Yes/No” into 1/0 for analysis. 
Q8. Handling Missing Data – Methods? 
• Deletion: Remove rows/columns with missing values. 
• Imputation: Replace with mean/median/mode. 
• Forward/Backward Fill: Copy previous or next value. 
• Predictive: Use regression/ML models to estimate missing values. 
Q9. What is Web Scraping? 
• Extracting data from websites. 
• Tools: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium. 
• Use Case: Scraping product prices from Amazon for comparison. 
Q10. What are Hierarchical Indexes in Pandas? 
• Multi-level indexing (row/column labels). 
• Helps in working with higher-dimensional data. 
• Example: Sales data indexed by [Region, Year]. 
Unit III – Data Visualization 
Q11. What is Data Visualization? 
• Converting raw data into visual form (charts, graphs). 
• Why? Humans understand visuals faster than numbers. 
• Example: Instead of reading sales figures, a bar chart shows product-wise revenue 
instantly. 
Q12. Common Visualization Types? 
• Bar Chart: Compare categories. 
• Line Chart: Trends over time. 
• Pie Chart: Proportions. 
• Histogram: Distribution of continuous data. 
• Scatter Plot: Relationship between two variables. 
• Heatmap: Correlation matrix visualization. 
Q13. What is a Dashboard? 
• A collection of charts/KPIs in one view. 
• Purpose: Monitoring business health, decision-making. 
• Example: A sales dashboard showing revenue, profit margin, top products, and regional 
performance. 
Q14. Difference between Tableau and Power BI? 
• Tableau: Strong at complex visualization, slightly costlier. 
• Power BI: Tight integration with Microsoft tools, more affordable. 
• Both: Used for creating dashboards, reports, and interactive analysis. 
Q15. What are Filters and Slicers? 
• Filter: Restricts data shown in visualizations. 
• Slicer: User-friendly filter UI (buttons, dropdowns). 
• Example: Filter sales report to show “only 2023” data. 
Unit IV – Power BI 
Q16. What is Power BI? 
• A Business Intelligence tool by Microsoft. 
• Use: Connects to multiple data sources, creates visualizations, builds dashboards. 
Q17. Power BI Desktop vs Power BI Service? 
• Desktop: Build and design reports locally. 
• Service (Cloud): Share, publish, collaborate online. 
Q18. What is Report Canvas? 
• The workspace in Power BI where you place charts, visuals, and KPIs. 
Q19. What is a Data Story? 
• Presenting insights step by step using visuals. 
• Makes data easy to understand for business stakeholders. 
• Example: Show sales growth → compare regions → highlight best-performing products. 
Q20. How to Publish a Power BI Report? 
• Click Publish in Power BI Desktop → Upload to Power BI Service → Share with team or 
embed in apps. 
Practical-Oriented Questions 
Q21. How to show visualization in Python? 
• Matplotlib: plt.plot(x, y) 
• Seaborn: sns.barplot(data=...) 
• Plotly: Interactive charts (px.scatter(df, x="Age", y="Salary")) 
Q22. How to show visualization in R? 
• Using ggplot2: 
ggplot(data, aes(x=Age, y=Salary)) + geom_point() 
Q23. Data Aggregation in Tableau? 
• Aggregating = summarizing. 
• Example: SUM of Sales, AVG of Profit, COUNT of Customers. 
• Allows comparing grouped data instead of individual rows. 
Q24. Tableau vs Zoho Analytics? 
• Tableau: Enterprise-grade, advanced custom visuals. 
• Zoho: Easier, cheaper, mostly cloud-based BI tool. 
Q25. What is a Gantt Chart? 
• Chart for project timelines. 
• X-axis = time, Y-axis = tasks. 
• Example: Visualizing software project schedule with deadlines.
