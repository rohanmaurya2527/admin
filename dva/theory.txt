Chart Types Explained - Plain Text Guide

1. Histogram
-------------
- What it shows: Distribution of a single continuous variable.
- It groups data into bins (ranges) and shows how many values fall into each.
- Use it to understand how data is spread.
- Example: Age distribution of people.

2. Pie Chart
-------------
- What it shows: Part-to-whole comparison.
- Each slice shows the proportion of a category within a whole.
- Best for showing percentages across 3â€“5 categories.
- Example: Market share of brands (Apple 40%, Samsung 35%, Others 25%).

3. Scatter Plot
----------------
- What it shows: Relationship between two numeric variables.
- Each point represents an observation.
- Use to detect patterns, trends, or outliers.
- Example: Study hours vs exam scores.

4. Line Plot
-------------
- What it shows: Change over time or ordered values.
- Points are connected by lines to show trends.
- Use for time-series data (e.g., sales over months).
- Example: Website traffic from Jan to June.
