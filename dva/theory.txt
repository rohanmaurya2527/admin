Chart Types Explained - Plain Text Guide

1. Histogram
-------------
- What it shows: Distribution of a single continuous variable.
- It groups data into bins (ranges) and shows how many values fall into each.
- Use it to understand how data is spread.
- Example: Age distribution of people.

2. Pie Chart
-------------
- What it shows: Part-to-whole comparison.
- Each slice shows the proportion of a category within a whole.
- Best for showing percentages across 3â€“5 categories.
- Example: Market share of brands (Apple 40%, Samsung 35%, Others 25%).

3. Scatter Plot
----------------
- What it shows: Relationship between two numeric variables.
- Each point represents an observation.
- Use to detect patterns, trends, or outliers.
- Example: Study hours vs exam scores.

4. Line Plot
-------------
- What it shows: Change over time or ordered values.
- Points are connected by lines to show trends.
- Use for time-series data (e.g., sales over months).
- Example: Website traffic from Jan to June.

5. Bar Chart
-------------
- What it shows: Comparison of categories.
- Uses vertical or horizontal bars.
- Best for comparing totals or averages across groups.
- Example: Sales by region (East, West, North, etc.).

Python Data Visualization Libraries - Overview

1. Matplotlib
--------------
- What it is: The foundational Python plotting library.
- Used to create static, 2D visualizations (basic to complex).
- Low-level but very customizable.
- It powers other libraries like Seaborn and Pandas plots.

Best For:
- Creating line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, etc.
- Highly customized static charts (e.g., for academic papers or reports).

Example Use:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()

2. Seaborn
-----------
- What it is: A high-level interface built on top of Matplotlib.
- Designed for statistical graphics and quick exploration.
- Comes with beautiful default styles and color themes.

Best For:
- Statistical plots (e.g., box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, regression lines).
- Fast and elegant visualizations for data analysis.

Example Use:
import seaborn as sns
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='category', y='value')

3. Plotly
----------
- What it is: A library for interactive, web-based visualizations.
- Allows zooming, tooltips, hover effects, and clickable charts.
- Can be used in Python, R, and JavaScript.

Best For:
- Dashboards, web apps, data storytelling.
- Sharing charts online or embedding them.

Example Use:
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(df, x="x_column", y="y_column", color="group")
fig.show()

4. Bokeh
---------
- What it is: A Python library for interactive plots in the browser.
- Similar to Plotly, but more developer-friendly for custom web apps.
- Can be integrated into HTML pages and dashboards (e.g., using Flask).

Best For:
- Creating live, interactive dashboards.
- Streaming data and embedding plots into websites.

Example Use:
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
p = figure()
p.line([1, 2, 3], [4, 6, 2])
show(p)
