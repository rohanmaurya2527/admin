Practical Viva Preparation Guide (Detailed) 
1. Data Collection, Cleaning, Modelling and Compilation 
Q1. Difference between Data Collection and Data Cleaning? 
• Collection → Gathering raw data (from surveys, sensors, APIs, databases). 
• Cleaning → Fixing errors, removing duplicates, handling missing values. 
Explanation: Collected data is often messy. Cleaning ensures quality before analysis. 
Q2. Why use .fillna() (mean, median, mode)? 
• Mean → Best when data is symmetric. 
• Median → Best when outliers exist. 
• Mode → Best for categorical data. 
Explanation: Missing values can bias results. .fillna() ensures continuity. 
Q3. Why handle missing values? 
• Models can’t handle NaN directly. 
• Missing data reduces accuracy and causes bias. 
Explanation: A dataset with 20% missing blood pressure values will give wrong medical 
insights. 
Q4. Difference between df.describe() and df.info()? 
• describe() → Statistical summary (mean, std, min, max, quartiles). 
• info() → Data types, null counts, memory usage. 
Explanation: describe() is numeric-focused, info() is structure-focused. 
Q5. What does index_col=0 do in read_csv()? 
• Uses first column as row index. 
Explanation: In student dataset, “Roll No” can become index instead of default 0,1,2.

• If p < 0.05 → Reject H₀. 
Q3. t-test vs z-test? 
• t-test → Small sample, unknown variance. 
• z-test → Large sample, known variance. 
Q4. Why α = 0.05?

Q5. What does reject H₀ mean? 
• Evidence supports alternate hypothesis. 
5. Exploring Categorical and Binary Data 
Q1. Difference categorical vs binary?

• Binary → Only 2 categories (e.g., Yes/No). 
Q2. Why one-hot encoding? 
• Converts categories into numeric columns for ML. 
Q3. What does value_counts() do? 
• Counts frequency of unique values. 
Q4. Countplot vs Histogram? 
• Countplot → Categorical counts.

Q5. Why encode categorical variables? 
• Models only work with numbers. 
6. ANOVA Testing 
Q1. What does ANOVA test? 
• Compares means of 3+ groups. 
Q2. One-way vs Two-way ANOVA? 
• One-way → One factor. 
• Two-way → Two factors and interaction. 
Q3. Meaning of significant F-test? 
• At least one group mean is different. 
Q4. Why not multiple t-tests? 
• Increases error probability. ANOVA controls this. 
Q5. Role of interaction in two-way ANOVA? 
• Shows if two factors influence results together. 
7. Non-Parametric Tests 
Q1. Why use them? 
• When data does not follow normal distribution. 
Q2. Wilcoxon vs Mann-Whitney? 
• Wilcoxon → Paired samples.
